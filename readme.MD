# Vehicle Registry System
Create a Java program that simulates a unique vehicle registry system using a Set and a custom class.
The system should be able to store a vehicle's VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), license plate, make, model, and year.
Since the VIN is a unique identifier for each vehicle, the system should not allow duplicate entries based on the VIN (hint: equals() and hashCode()).
It should be able to perform the following operations:

1. Add a vehicle to the registry (if it doesn't already exist).
2. Remove a vehicle from the registry using the VIN.
3. Check if a vehicle with a given VIN is in the registry.
4. Display the list of vehicles in the registry.

Add minimal unit tests for the first 3 operations.
